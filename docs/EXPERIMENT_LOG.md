# Experiment log

Chronological record of every experiment run in this repository, with honest results.
**Append-only.** Newest at the bottom. Never edit an earlier entry to agree with a later one —
if a result is superseded, add a new entry that says so and cross-reference both.

## Conventions

- **VERIFIED** = ran here, output observed and saved to `../artifacts/`.
  **UNVERIFIED** = not checked here.
- **Every number states the data it came from.** A metric with no stated split and sample count
  is a bug, not a result.
- **Training losses do not appear in this file.** They are diagnostics. See `LANDMINES.md` §4.
- Subset or laptop-scale results are never compared to published leaderboard numbers without
  stating why the comparison is invalid.
- No published figure is quoted until it has been **fetched** and the source recorded.
- Every entry names what it **does not** establish. That line is mandatory.

## E000 — reserved

Nothing has been run in this repository yet. The first entry will be the evaluation-harness
validation gate (`DECISIONS.md` D-03), **not** a model result.

## E0 — evaluator harness sanity check (real vs. real), NOT the D-03 gate itself

**Ran by:** `../scripts/e0_evaluator_sanity_check.py`   **Date:** 2026-09-06
**Seeds:** 0, 1 (both full test split; seed only affects which random unit-length crop and
train/test split partition point is used — see spread below)
**Data:** HF `TeoGchx/HumanML3D`, `test` split, streamed (not bulk-downloaded), all 4384 sequences
that pass the length filter (40-199 frames) -> 4198 usable samples, split into two disjoint
halves of ~2099 each
**Record:** `../artifacts/e0/e0_evaluator_sanity_check_record_seed0.json`,
`../artifacts/e0/e0_evaluator_sanity_check_record_seed1.json`
**Status:** PARTIAL — see "Does NOT establish" below. This is a precursor sanity check, not a
completed D-03 gate.

**Hypothesis (pre-registered, stated before running):** the vendored Guo et al. evaluator
(`third_party/text-to-motion/`, checkpoint sourced from a third-party HF re-upload,
architecture-verified against the evaluator's own model classes — see
`third_party/text-to-motion/PATCHES.md`) should produce sane, signal-carrying numbers when run on
real HumanML3D data: matched (text, motion) pairs should retrieve each other far above chance in
a 32-candidate R-Precision batch (paper's own protocol), and FID between two disjoint real-data
subsets should be small, in the neighborhood of (though not necessarily identical to) the paper's
own "Real"-row FID of 0.002.

**Success criterion (pre-registered):** R-Precision-top3 comparable to the paper's 0.797 (same
ballpark, not required to match exactly given this uses disjoint subsets and a single random crop
per motion rather than the paper's exact protocol); FID small and stable across sample-size
increases and across seeds.

| metric | seed 0 | seed 1 | spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-Precision top-1 | 0.4269 | 0.4264 | 0.0005 |
| R-Precision top-2 | 0.6159 | 0.6144 | 0.0015 |
| R-Precision top-3 | 0.7202 | 0.7159 | 0.0043 |
| matching score | 3.6057 | 3.6084 | 0.0027 |
| FID (real vs. real, disjoint 2099/2099) | 0.02870 | 0.02890 | 0.00020 |

Seed spread is tiny relative to the effect sizes discussed below (e.g. R-Prec-top3's ~0.4 point
spread vs. its ~7.7-point gap from the paper's 0.797) — this ran entirely on CPU (not MPS), so
the residual spread reflects only which random unit-length crop/subset-split each seed drew, not
device non-determinism (`LANDMINES.md` §7 does not apply to this particular check).

**Progression observed as protocol was corrected (all real data, all seed 0):**

| version | n samples (A/B) | R-Precision batching | R-Prec-top3 | FID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 (bug) | 200/200 | single batch of 200 (1 correct + 199 distractors) | 0.280 | 0.745 |
| v2 (fixed batching) | 1024/1024 | 32-candidate batches, averaged | 0.710 | 0.173 |
| v3 (full test split) | 2099/2099 | 32-candidate batches, averaged | 0.720 | 0.029 |

**Result:** the harness is clearly producing real, meaningful signal — matched text/motion pairs
retrieve each other at 72% top-3 accuracy out of 32 candidates (vs. ~9% chance), and FID between
disjoint real subsets fell by 25x (0.745 -> 0.029) purely from fixing the R-Precision batch size
and increasing sample count to the full test split, with no other change. This is strong evidence
the checkpoint, the text/motion encoders, and this project's own data-preparation code (caption
tokenization, unit-length cropping, Z-normalization with the official Mean.npy/Std.npy) are all
working correctly together. **The v1 bug is documented here rather than silently fixed and
forgotten** — a 200-candidate R-Precision pool is a real methodological mistake this project's
own code made, caught before being reported as a result, which is exactly the discipline
`LANDMINES.md` exists to enforce on this project's own work, not just the original's.

The remaining gap from the paper's own numbers (R-Prec-top3 0.720 vs. 0.797; FID 0.029 vs. 0.002)
is real and did not close further between the 1024-sample and 2099-sample (full split) runs,
suggesting it is not primarily a sample-size artifact. Most likely explanation, not yet
confirmed: this script uses a single random unit-length crop per motion, while the paper's
`final_evaluations.py` protocol conventionally evaluates with `--repeat_time` averaging over
multiple crops/seeds per sample — this project's version does not yet replicate that averaging.

**Establishes:** the vendored evaluator harness (checkpoint + encoders + this project's own data
pipeline) is functioning and produces results in the correct ballpark on real data, not degenerate
or broken. The checkpoint's architecture-match to the official evaluator (documented in
`third_party/text-to-motion/PATCHES.md`) is now also behaviorally corroborated, not just
shape-corroborated.

**Does NOT establish:**
- **This is NOT the D-03 gate.** D-03 requires reproducing a *published generated-model* number
  (e.g. MDM's FID 0.544) to a stated tolerance. This entry only validates the harness against
  real data, which has no generative model in the loop at all yet.
- Does not establish that the ~0.72 vs. 0.797 R-Precision gap and ~0.029 vs. 0.002 FID gap are
  fully understood — the multi-crop-averaging hypothesis above is a plausible, not confirmed,
  explanation.
- Does not establish the checkpoint is byte-identical to the original Google-Drive-hosted file —
  only that it is architecturally and behaviorally consistent with it (see PATCHES.md).
- Does not establish anything about MPS — this ran entirely on CPU (the evaluator's BiGRU
  encoders are small; CPU inference is fast and avoids `LANDMINES.md` §7's non-determinism
  entirely for this particular check, which is why seed-0 reran bit-for-identical).

**Next:** obtain an actual generated model's output (MDM's own released checkpoint/samples, or
this project's own future E2 baseline) to complete the actual D-03 gate — reproduce a published
generated-model FID to a stated tolerance, per `REBUILD_SPEC.md` §6's E0 definition.
